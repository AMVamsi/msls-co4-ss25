    "### **Note: Morphological operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological operations are a set of operations used to analyze and manipulate the shape of objects in an image. Although they are defined for various image types, they are most commonly applied to binary images. These operations involve a structuring element (kernel) that probes the image and modifies pixel values based on the interaction between the kernel and the image. The most common operations include dilation (expands shapes), erosion (shrinks shapes), opening (erosion followed by dilation), and closing (dilation followed by erosion). Morphological operations are useful for removing noise, separating objects, and connecting disjoint regions in an image. There is a separate notebook on morphological operations.\n",

    "### **Note: Distance transform**\n",
    "The distance transform is useful for various image processing tasks. It computes the distance from each pixel to the nearest boundary (i.e., the closest background pixel) in a binary image. Distance transforms are used for operations like skeletonization, shape analysis, and segmentation. The algorithm propagates distance values from boundary pixels inward, typically using a metric such as the Euclidean distance. It is computationally efficient and widely available in image processing libraries.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Note: Connected components**\n",
    "\n",
    "Connected components are regions in a binary image where pixels are connected based on predefined neighborhood rules (e.g., 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity). This technique is used to identify individual objects in a segmentation mask. The algorithm labels each connected region with a unique integer value, allowing for further analysis such as counting or measuring properties of each component.\n",

Unlike classical methods, deep learning models can learn features directly from the data and often generalize better to unseen examples. However, they require large labeled datasets for training, are more computationally demanding, and are often seen as \"black boxes\" – making it difficult to interpret their decisions.\n",
